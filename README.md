# Learning-HTML
Here are some practice websites I will build while learning HTML.

Notes: 

The main element is used to represent the main content of the body of an HTML document. Contect inside the main document should be unique and should not be repeated in other parts of the document.
The main element is an element that needs both an opening tag and a closing tag.

The img element has a self-closing tag. For example, you do not need to put <img> <\img>.

The section element helps seperate images from future content.
This element helps with Search Engine Optimization and accessibility.

The figure element represents self-contained content and will allow you to associate an image with a caption.
