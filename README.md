# Learning-HTML
Here are some practice websites I will build while learning HTML.

Notes: 

The main element is used to represent the main content of the body of an HTML document. Content inside the main document should be unique and should not be repeated in other parts of the document.
The main element is an element that needs both an opening tag and a closing tag.

The section element helps seperate images from future content. This element helps with Search Engine Optimization and accessibility. 

The img element has a self-closing tag. For example, you do not need to put <img> <\img>.
The following src attribute in the element img specifies the images URL (where the image is located). 
All img elements should have an alt attribute. The alt attribute's text is used for screen readers to improve accessiblity and is displayed if the image fails to load.

You can turn a text into a link.
You can link another page with the anchor element (a). The anchor element is NOT a self-closing tag.
A links text must be placed between the opening and closing tags of the anchor element (a).
To open links an a new tab, you can use the target attribute to the anchor (a) element. The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document. 

The section element helps seperate images from future content.
This element helps with Search Engine Optimization and accessibility.

The figure element represents self-contained content and will allow you to associate an image with a caption.

The figcaption element is used to add a caption to describe the image within the figure element.
                                        
The following src attribute in the element img specifies the images URL (where the image is located). 
All img elements should have an alt attribute. The alt attribute's text is used for screen readers to improve accessiblity and is displayed if the image fails to load. -->
